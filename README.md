# Groovy Closure Execution Failure

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to closure execution in Groovy. The `methodWithClosure` function executes a provided closure, but under certain circumstances, the closure may fail to execute correctly or may throw unexpected exceptions.

## Bug Description
The issue is centered around the potential for unexpected behavior when a closure interacts with variables or objects outside of its immediate scope.  Incorrect handling of this interaction can lead to the closure not being executed as expected or to runtime errors.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.groovy`.
3. Observe that the closure might not execute or throw an exception.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the proper scoping and handling of variables and objects used within the closure. The `bugSolution.groovy` file demonstrates the correct approach in this scenario.
