```groovy
def methodWithClosure(closure) {
  println "Before closure execution"
  closure()
  println "After closure execution"
}

methodWithClosure { println "Inside closure" }

// Unexpected behavior: the closure might not execute at all or might throw unexpected exceptions due to issues with the closure's scope or context, particularly if it involves external variables or objects.
```
